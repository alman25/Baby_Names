### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to view trends in baby names based on US social security data from 1980-2010. By analyzing various trends, we can track
changes in name popularity including across different regions and decades.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is from "names_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each name, year and location.

### Tools

- SQL - Data Analysis

### Exploration Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What are the overall most popular girl and boy names? How they have changed in popularity rankings over the years.
- What are the 3 most popular girl names and 3 most popular boy names for each year?
- What are the 3 most popular girl names and 3 most popular boy names within each region?

### Data Analysis
- I provided a document to the answers and questions to my analysis.

### Results
The most ordered item on the menu were hamburgers. However, when evaluating the the most expensive food orders, italian food was the most commonly spent item. 

### Recommendations
From this database, the highest spend orders were primarily on italian food. The high priced italian food should remain on the menu since people are ordering them a lot
especially from the highest spent customers.
