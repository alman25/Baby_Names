### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to view trends in baby names based on US social security data from 1980-2009. By analyzing various trends, we can track
changes in name popularity including across different regions and decades.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is from "names_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about baby names, and the year and location of their births.

### Tools

- What are the overall most popular girl and boy names? How they have changed in popularity rankings over the years.
- Find the 10 most popular androgynous names (names given to both females and males)
- Find the length of the shortest and longest names and identify the most popular short
names (those with the fewest characters) and long names (those with the most characters)
