### About

This project explores trends in baby name popularity across the United States using MySQL and Social Security data from 1980 to 2010. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about naming patterns over time, across regions, and within unique categories. The analysis focuses on:

### Track Changes in Name Popularity

• Identify the overall most popular girl and boy names and how their rankings evolved over the years

• Find names with the biggest jumps in popularity between 1980 and 2010

### Compare Popularity Across Decades

• Retrieve the top 3 most popular girl and boy names for each year

• Retrieve the top 3 most popular girl and boy names for each decade

### Compare Popularity Across Regions

• Count the number of babies born in each of the six U.S. regions (with MI included in the Midwest)

• Return the top 3 most popular girl and boy names within each region

### Explore Unique Names in the Dataset

• Identify the 10 most popular androgynous names (used for both genders)

• Determine the shortest and longest names by character length and identify the most popular names in each category

• Find the state with the highest percentage of babies named “Chris”

This project demonstrates strong SQL skills through filtering, joins, aggregations, window functions, and ranking functions, producing insightful and engaging results on naming trends in the U.S. over three decades.
